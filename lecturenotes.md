## Lecture 1 - Jan 6th
### Introduction
Lots of Boilerplate, nothing seriously relevant.

### C++ Boot Camp
This course doesn't teach you C\++. It teaches you how to make things with C\++.

Nevertheless, it's still important to know the language, so this is a short summary of what's changed / been added from C.

#### Class vs. Struct
Same thing, but *Structs* have all their elements **Public** by default, and *Classes* have all their elements **Private** by default.

Structs are better from procedural programming, Classes are mainly for OOP.

Also, don't mix and match (even though you can).

#### Style considerations:
- Readability is important. One liners may look cool, but they aren't really readable.
- Use for loops over while loops most of the time.
- Use curly braces, even when you don't need to (single liners).
- Testing infrastructure is important.

#### Sample Code
#### *first.cpp*
```cpp
	#include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    using namespace std;

    // globals
    const string kidDrink = "juice";
    string adultDrink = "coffee";

    int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
    	int age = 100;
        while (age > 0) {
        	cout << "How old are you?";
            cin >> age;
            cout << "Would you like some ";
            if (age < 18) {
            	cout << kidDrink << "?" << endl;
            } else {
            	cout << adultDrink << "?" << endl;
            }
            if (age == 47) {
            	adultDrink = "beer"; // changes global var
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

Notice:
- `using namespace std;` -- Use this, or else errors. Why? You'll learn.
- How input and output work.

#### Booleans
`bool` is a built in type in C\++. Use it, it's nice!
It lets you write `bool someBool = true;` or `bool someBool = false;`.
Nevertheless, C\++ still lets you treat 0 as False, and non-zero as True (like in C).

#### Chars and Strings
**DONT USE `char*` WHEN YOU CAN AVOID IT**.
C\++ has a better built in string library!

Here is a brief summary of it:

Operation|What it does
--|--
`+` | string catenation
`==, <=, <, etc.	` |comparison	based	on	standard	lexical	ordering	
`s.length()` 	 |	number	of	chars	in	s		
`s.substr(i,n)`|substring	of	n	characters	starQng	at	index	i		
`s.substr(i)` |substr	starQng	at	index	i	and	ending	at	the	end	of	s		
`s.at(i)` 	|		returns	ith char	(checked	access)		
`s[i]` 	|			returns	ith	char	(unchecked	access)	
`s.c_str()` 	| 	returns	the	C-style	char*	equivalent	of	s		
`s.find(str, pos)`| return	first	index	of	str	in	s	starQng	at	or	aver	pos	\**	
`s.rfind(str, pos)` |return	last	index	of	str	in	s	starQng	at	or	before	pos	\**	
`s.replace(...)` |replace	chars	within	s		
`s.insert(...)`| insert	chars	within	s

\** returns -1 if str is not found (technically, that's string::npos)

Now, chars	have	a	dual	nature:	they're	both	characters	AND	integers:	
- When	you	use	the	"+"	operator	on	chars,	it	performs	integer	
addiQon,	not	string	catenaQon.		
- â€¦	but	when	you	print	a	char,	you	get	the	character	not	the	integer.

Take the following example code:

```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>
    using namespace std;

    int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
        cout << "m" << endl;                       // m
        cout << 'm' << endl;                       // m
        cout << (int) 'm' << endl;                 // 109
        cout << "m" + "g" << endl;                 // Won't compile.
        cout << (string)"m" + (string)"g" << endl; // mg
        cout << (string) "m" + 'g' << endl;        // mg
        cout << 'm' + 'g' << endl;                 // 212=109+103
        return 0;
    }
```
